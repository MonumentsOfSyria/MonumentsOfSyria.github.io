This site near Qanawat in the southern reaches of the Jebel Hauran has yielded important insights into the art and architecture of this area in the early classical period. However, the widespread looting of the site for stone in the late Ottoman period has left little for the visitor to appreciate without a careful study of the pattern among the jumble of stones.
To help you unscramble this complex of several temples and courtyards along a ridge site, pages 285–286 of the third edition of 'Monuments of Syria' (I B Tauris, London, 2009) includes a discussion and a plan.
