This gallery records the tower tombs which were destroyed in the Valley of the Tombs, Palmyra, apparently as a result of explosions set by 'Islamic State' in the days leading up to 2 Sep 2015. The first panel notes the tombs which had been destroyed as of 2 Sep 2015. The second panel is extracted from my comprehensive map of Palmyra and marks the destroyed tombs with red flashes.
